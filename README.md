Hi there!

Lately I've been reading about technical communication, design, engineering management, consulting, blockchain (cryptography, distributed systems, economics), code quality, functional programming, and the history of the internet.


Most of my personal notes have been moved to private repos, or an EverNote stack.

Feel free reach out on Twitter (`sdtsui`) if you'd like to chat about any of this!
