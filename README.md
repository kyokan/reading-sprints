#### `reading-sprints`

Notes from Dan's personal reading. Started Q2 2017.

Lately I'e been reading about technical communication, management, blockchain (cryptography, distributed systems), code quality, functional programming, and the history of the internet.

Reach out on Twitter (`sdtsui`) if you'd like to chat about any of this!
