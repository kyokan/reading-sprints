Takeaway:
- How do I set up productive 'information filters' for 2018?
- Enabling "Species-level" Impact:
  - What networks do I **need** to embed myself in?
  - What experiences are on the critical path?  What knowledge/skills will allow those experiences to occur?
  - How will I measure success?  //  What aspects of success are unmeasurable?
- What aspects of the above intentions can I infuse into the teams I lead?
- Say 'no' to new information by default, but give everything your full attention.
  - Few interests, stay focused.
  - Execute violently.
  - Overlaps with Lucio's advice (LE, HandsITD).

Context:
- Recommended by an associate of patrick (PBD).
- Most of the language in this book imprecise, not actionable.
- Still something to learn from it: still points at an underlying truth about setting long-term strategy for teams and individuals.
