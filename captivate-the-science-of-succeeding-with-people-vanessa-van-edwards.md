        - intentional questions, listening deeply, trying to connect with someone on their terms.
        - WE WANT TO BE SOLVED, it makes us feel heard and understood.

    - Don't invite Quality Time people to do boring activities. Forget coffee -- ask them to go on a hike or to a grilled cheese shop.
      - walks or runs instead of a typical lunch
    - physical touch partner or friend: learn how to give massages or do reflexology

    What do we want? 
       Are we filling a missing need?
       Are we finding what we lack?
       What gives us purpose?

    MOST PEOPLE's CHOICES MAKE SENSE TO THEM.
