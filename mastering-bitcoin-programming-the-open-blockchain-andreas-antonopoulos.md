8. Mining and Consensus ***
Mining is the process by which the decentralized clearinghouse runs, by which transactions are validated and cleared.

Mining secures the bitcoin system and enables the emergence of network-wide consensus without a central authority.


Deflationary Money: not the greatest argument against hoarding instinct being problematic.

Consensus Attacks:
  - Consensus attacks do not affect the security of private keys and signing algorithm.
  - Cannot steal bitcoins, spend bitcoins without signatures, redirect bitcoins, or otherwise changep ast transactions or ownership records.
  - A consensus attack can only affec the most recent blocks and cause denial of service distruptions on the creation of future blocks.

Much less than 51% is needed.
  - 51% threshold is simply the level at which such an attack is almost guaranteed to succeed.
  - A consensus attack is essentially a tug of war for the next block..
