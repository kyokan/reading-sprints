Conclusions:
  - "intervididual"
- Multicultural identities are interdividual: multicultural distinctions are differences do not stand on their own, but exist only in relation to one another.
- Multiculturalists act as if each "victim" is endowed with some sort of independent essence, requiring special needs, space, but to describe this position is to refute it. "Victims" can exist only if there exist oppressors, in relation to whom victim status may be defined.
- One should not take multiculturalists at face value when they claim to be recognizing individual identities that, like some sort of Platonic forms, preexist the multiculture -- and that have been submerged (often for centuries) by oppressive Western society.

The opposite is the case: multicultural identities are constructed by the multiculture itself -- each actor plays a role in a larger theoretical productions.

  - "ressentiment"

Not merely resentment; it is resentment compounded by a frustration over not being able to relieve the source of that resentment. In a destructive circle, frustration breeds more resentment, which in tern exacerbates the frustration. 

For multiculturalists who have adopted fake racial and gender identities, the resentment of their oppression is compounded by a frustration over not being able to relieve its source. They cannot relieve their oppression both because it is largely imaginary, and because this fantasy provides the backbone of their identity.

- Feminist SK unwittingly summed up the dilemma: "it is hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head"

- Ressentiment is the interdividual force that bonds the disparate elements of the multiculture.


- no amount of academic recognition would satisfy the Afrocentrists, or that public recognition would appease the homosexuals who deliberately contracted H.I.V.
- no change in the behavior of pharmaceutical companies would end their vilification because no specific action they took led to their scapegoating. 
- In the culture of blame, they have become an end in themselves.




The Problem and the Solution:
  - We examine cultural phenomenon applying anthropological techniques.
  - 

We have focused on the way this new culture is organized:
  - how personal identity is conceived
  - what domains are sacred and which ones are taboo

- Multiculture can be thought of as a neoprimitive culture in which individuals are not recognized -- in a sense, do not even exist.

- People conceive of their identity relationally, in a way that is profoundly dysfunctional: racial minorities in relation to racism, women in relation to sexism, homosexuals in relation to homophobia. 

These interdividual identities drive multicultural ressentiment and require multiculturalists to expel and denounce their (largely imaginary) enemies; instead of the rule of law, one sees an archaic scapegoating ritual cgone bersek.


- Multiculture is antirational, incapable of perceiving itself as it really is --- appears shallow and hypocritical, but these are merely symptoms of the underlying illness: the core problem with multiculture is interdividuality itself.
  - People must transcend their interdividual identities.



Takeaway:

- When defining one's identity, be wary of defining it in relation to something else.
- What are you, _really_?
