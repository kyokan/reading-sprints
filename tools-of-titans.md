- Angel Investing Chapter
- Optimal Portfolio Size. Diagram of max/min investment amounts. Potential to make back the entire portfolio.
  - Assume we need 100k to write the chceks.
- Need history of growth curve of coins.

Proxies:
  - Eth crowdsale
  - Ripple
  - BTC Price growth...hype cycles.

Create the average success outcome:
  - What is the single "success outcome" needed to remake the fund?

Tim's Plannning:

- Two-Year, 120k Fund.
- Assume it's lost.


Do not mimick this approaching unless:
  - You have a clear informational advantage (insider access) that gives you a competitive edge.
  - 100% comfortable losing your funds.
  - You have started and/or managed successful businesses in the past.
  - You limit angel investment funds to 10 to 15% or less of your liquid assets.
    - 90%+ in conservative investments (cash-like equivalents), 10% in speculative investments


Notes:
- People overestimate risk tolerance. "I won't panick unless down 20% in a quarter -> in practice, ~5% in a quarter".


*** Baseline Rules ***
- Formulate intelligent rules. Follow them.
  - If it has a single founder, founder must be technical. Two technical cofounders are ideal.
  - I must be eager to use the product myself.
  - Products and I can directly impact through my skills, platform, promotion.
  - More than 100k active users OR serial founder(s) with past exits OR more than 10k paying customers. Whenever possible, I want to pour gasoline on the fire, not start the fire.
  - More than 10% month-on-month activity growth.
  - Clean "cap table", minimal previous financing (or none), no bridge rounds.
  - US based companies, or companies willing to create US-based investable entites.
  - Have the founders had crappy service jobs, like waiting tables or bussing at restaurants? If so, they tend to stay grounded for longer.

- Mike Maples: 
  - breaking your rules to co-invest is a terrible idea
  - following your rules when others reject can work out extremely well

*** Arbitrary Rules, to filter out more investments and sharpen focus ***
- If each startup exits at 5 times its current Series A valuation, it should be able to cover two-thirds of your fund capital.
- If a startup exists at 3 times its current valuation, it should allow you to walk away with 300k.
- Move from Investor -> Investor/Advisor -> Advisory
  - Establish your reputation as a major value-add: rock-solid frontend skills.

-----------

- Set aside a fund, in Fiat. Lock it down, record it, and constantly rebalance at no greater than 40% of NW.
- Create a "safe" class of top tier cryptos. Buy and hold, use it as the basis for rebalancing.
- Create a "speculative" class of smaller cryptos: short/medium term.  Become active here: adding frontend value, approach the core team for coins.  Pre-crowdsale.
